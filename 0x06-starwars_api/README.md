# Star Wars API
To complete this project, you need to fetch and display Star Wars characters using an external API. Key concepts include HTTP requests, RESTful APIs, JSON parsing, asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await), command-line arguments, and array manipulation in JavaScript. Master these to efficiently handle API data.
