# Making Change
The Coin Change Problem requires finding the minimum number of coins for a given amount using specified denominations. You must choose between a greedy algorithm (fast but not always optimal) and dynamic programming (guarantees optimal solutions by solving subproblems). Focus on algorithm efficiency and Python programming for implementation.
